## 📄 File Descriptions

### Core Application Files

#### `index.html` (Frontend)
**Purpose:** Production-ready web interface for QR code generation

**What it does:**
- Provides user-friendly form for QR code configuration
- Validates user input (content, file uploads)
- Communicates with backend via HTTP POST requests
- Displays generated QR codes
- Enables QR code downloads
- Shows real-time status and error messages

**Why it's needed:**
- **User Interface:** Without this, users have no way to interact with the system
- **Client-side validation:** Reduces unnecessary backend requests
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for screen readers and keyboards
- **Security:** Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- **UX:** Real-time feedback and error handling

**Key Features:**
- Animated gradient background
- Glass morphism design
- Form validation with inline errors
- Loading states with spinners
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
- Screen reader support
- Console logging for debugging

**Dependencies:**
- Backend API at `/generate-qr` endpoint
- Modern browser with ES6+ support

---

#### `app.py` (Backend Server)
**Purpose:** Flask web server that handles HTTP requests and orchestrates QR generation

**What it does:**
- Serves the frontend HTML file
- Exposes REST API endpoint `/generate-qr`
- Validates incoming requests
- Handles file uploads (logos)
- Calls `qrGenerator.py` to create QR codes
- Manages temporary file cleanup
- Serves generated QR code images
- Returns JSON responses to frontend

**Why it's needed:**
- **HTTP Server:** Bridges frontend and backend logic
- **Request Handling:** Processes form data and file uploads
- **CORS:** Enables cross-origin requests for development
- **File Management:** Creates necessary directories, cleans up temp files
- **Error Handling:** Catches exceptions and returns meaningful errors
- **Static File Serving:** Makes generated QR codes accessible

**Key Features:**
- CORS enabled for development
- UUID-based unique filenames
- Automatic directory creation
- Temporary file cleanup
- RESTful API design
- Error handling and logging

**Dependencies:**
- `flask` - Web framework
- `flask-cors` - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- `qrGenerator.py` - QR code generation module
- `uuid` - Unique filename generation
- `os` - File system operations

**Configuration:**
- Host: `0.0.0.0` (accessible from network)
- Port: `5000`
- Debug mode: Enabled (disable in production)

---

#### `qrGenerator.py` (Core Logic)
**Purpose:** Pure Python module for QR code generation with customizations

**What it does:**
- Generates QR codes from text/URL data
- Adds owner name and title text above QR code
- Embeds logo images in the center of QR codes
- Applies text shadows for better readability
- Saves images in PNG format with optimization
- Handles font loading (Arial or fallback)
- Generates timestamped filenames

**Why it's needed:**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps QR logic independent from web server
- **Reusability:** Can be imported by other Python scripts
- **Testability:** Pure functions are easier to test
- **Maintainability:** Changes to QR logic don't affect server code
- **Error Correction:** Uses HIGH level for better scanning with logos

**Key Features:**
- High error correction (ERROR_CORRECT_H)
- Auto-fitting QR version
- Logo transparency handling (RGBA support)
- Text centering with shadow effects
- Font fallback system
- Image optimization (quality=95)

**Dependencies:**
- `qrcode` - QR code generation
- `PIL` (Pillow) - Image manipulation
- `os` - File path operations
- `datetime` - Timestamp generation

**Functions:**
- `generate_qr_with_customizations()` - Main entry point
- `load_font()` - Font loading with fallback
- `get_smaller_font()` - Font size adjustment
- `add_text()` - Text rendering with shadows
- `add_logo()` - Logo embedding
- `generate_filename()` - Timestamp-based naming

---

### Directory Structures

#### `static/qrcodes/`
**Purpose:** Storage directory for generated QR code images

**What it contains:**
- PNG images of generated QR codes
- Filenames are UUIDs (e.g., `a1b2c3d4.png`)

**Why it's needed:**
- **Persistence:** Keeps generated QR codes accessible
- **Web Serving:** Flask serves files from here via `/static/qrcodes/` URL
- **Organization:** Separates QR codes from other static assets

**Characteristics:**
- Auto-created by `app.py` if missing
- Files persist until manually deleted
- Should be added to `.gitignore` (don't commit generated files)

**Maintenance:**
- Consider implementing cleanup script for old files
- Monitor disk usage in production
- Backup important QR codes separately

---

#### `uploads/`
**Purpose:** Temporary storage for uploaded logo files

**What it contains:**
- Logo images uploaded by users
- Temporary files with UUID-based names

**Why it's needed:**
- **File Processing:** Logos need to be saved before being read by PIL
- **Security:** Isolated from static files served to users
- **Cleanup:** Files are automatically deleted after QR generation

**Characteristics:**
- Auto-created by `app.py` if missing
- Files are ephemeral (deleted immediately after use)
- Should be added to `.gitignore`

**Security Notes:**
- Never serve files directly from this directory
- Validate file types and sizes
- Implement virus scanning for production

---

### Configuration Files

#### `requirements.txt`
**Purpose:** Python package dependencies

**Contents:**
```
flask==3.0.0
flask-cors==4.0.0
qrcode==7.4.2
pillow==10.1.0
```

**Why it's needed:**
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent environment across machines
- **Deployment:** Simplifies dependency installation
- **Version Control:** Locks specific package versions
- **Documentation:** Lists all required packages

**Usage:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### `.gitignore` (Recommended)
**Purpose:** Tells Git which files to ignore

**Recommended contents:**
```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
venv/

# Project specific
static/qrcodes/*.png
uploads/*
!uploads/.gitkeep
*.log

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
```

**Why it's needed:**
- **Clean Repository:** Don't commit generated files
- **Security:** Prevents committing sensitive data
- **Collaboration:** Reduces merge conflicts
- **Size:** Keeps repo size manageable
